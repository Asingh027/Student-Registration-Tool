# Student Registration Tool

Welcome to NJIT's Student Registration Tool source code! This tool serves as my submission for the final project of CS 631 - Database Management System Design.

In this project, we undertook the following steps:

* Designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram
* Generated a Relational Schema based on the ER Diagram
* Applied Normalization to the Relational Schema to reduce redundancy
* Utilized MySQL commands to implement the Normalized Relational Schema
* Utilized Python to connect to and query the locally-hosted MySQL Server for information on students, courses, sections, instructors, and registration information
* Composed an in-depth user guide to instruct students on how to utilize the product and explained the methodologies behind the MySQL and Python implementations
